- Static typing: mypy --strict must pass; no Any unless unavoidable and then # type: ignore  # SPEC:justify.
- Docstrings: NumPy style.
- Logging: always via utils.log.get_logger(__name__); never print().
- Imports: absolute (from wf.storage import dao)â€”no relative dot hops outside package.
- Use f-strings for string formatting.
- Use the dao for all database calls. Never have SQL code directly exposed in modules - they must go through the dao.
